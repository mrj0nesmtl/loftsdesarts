## Risk Assessment

| Risk | Impact | Probability | Mitigation Strategy |
|------|--------|------------|---------------------|
| Development timeline slippage | High | Medium | Weekly progress tracking with buffer days added to each phase |
| Supabase rate limiting | Medium | Low | Implement request queuing and optimize database queries |
| Mobile compatibility issues | Medium | Medium | Enhance device testing matrix and implement responsive design checks |
| Content translation delays | Medium | High | Prioritize core functionality text and implement a translation workflow |
| User adoption challenges | High | Medium | Plan user training sessions and create comprehensive documentation |

## Notes
- Initial admin access limited to board members only
- All data stored in Supabase with proper Row Level Security
- Content population for building information ongoing with stakeholder input
- Mobile testing framework implemented with custom Next.js script
