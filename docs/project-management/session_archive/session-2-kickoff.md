## Addendum: Critical Issues to Address

### Identified Production Issues

1. **Contact Form Submission Error**
   - **Issue**: Public users cannot submit contact forms due to RLS policy restrictions
   - **Impact**: Medium-High (Core public site functionality blocked)
   - **Solution**: Add appropriate RLS policy for public inserts or modify server action to use admin client
   - **Priority**: High (Will be fixed during Week 1 as a priority task)
   - **Assignment**: Backend Developer
   - **Verification Method**: End-to-end testing with multiple form submissions
   - **Estimated Resolution Time**: 3-4 hours

This issue was discovered during live testing on mobile devices. The contact form successfully validates input but fails when attempting to insert data into the Supabase database due to missing Row Level Security policies for public users. 

Since contact form functionality is a critical part of the public-facing site, this should be prioritized in our Session 2 work to ensure potential residents and visitors can communicate with the board effectively.
