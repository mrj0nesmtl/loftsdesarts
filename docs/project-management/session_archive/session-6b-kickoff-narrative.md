# Session 6: Resident Portal Implementation

*Date: April 6, 2025*

## Overview

Welcome to Session 6 of the Lofts des Arts platform development! With the successful completion of Phase 2, which delivered a comprehensive admin interface with document management, package handling, and a robust theme system, we're now ready to shift our focus to the resident-facing features of the platform.

This session will focus on implementing the core functionality of the Resident Portal (Phase 3), which will allow residents to access building information, track packages, communicate with management, and submit maintenance requests.

## Primary Objectives

1. **Resident Authentication System** - Implement secure authentication specific to residents, with unit verification
2. **Profile Management** - Create the resident profile system with personal information and household management
3. **Messaging System Completion** - Complete the real-time messaging functionality between residents and management
4. **Package Notification System** - Develop the resident-facing package tracking interface
5. **Building Information Repository** - Create the knowledge base for building information and rules
6. **Inquiry System Improvements** - Enhance the inquiry management system with better categorization and response tools
7. **Newsletter System** - Implement a subscription-based newsletter system for building announcements

## Technical Focus Areas

- **Authentication Flow** - Email verification, unit validation, and secure authentication processes
- **Real-time Communication** - WebSocket implementation for live messaging updates
- **User Experience** - Intuitive and accessible interfaces for residents of all technical abilities
- **Mobile Responsiveness** - Ensuring all resident interfaces work perfectly on mobile devices
- **Theme Consistency** - Maintaining our theme system standards across all new components
- **Email Delivery** - Reliable newsletter delivery with tracking capabilities
- **Data Management** - Efficient handling of resident communication and inquiries

## Development Approach

We'll tackle the Resident Portal implementation using an iterative approach:

1. First establish the authentication and profile management foundation
2. Build the core interfaces for each feature module
3. Implement the real-time functionality and notifications
4. Integrate with existing admin-side systems
5. Conduct comprehensive testing with user scenarios

## Session 6, Part 2 Focus

In Part 2 of Session 6, we'll concentrate on completing the following key systems:

1. **Messaging System**
   - Fix the 404 error when clicking "Message a Resident"
   - Implement missing route handlers for resident messaging
   - Complete the message thread and composition components
   - Integrate real-time updates with WebSockets

2. **Inquiry System Improvements**
   - Enhance inquiry categorization and routing
   - Implement response templates
   - Create a more intuitive inquiry management interface
   - Improve the inquiry analytics and tracking

3. **Newsletter System**
   - Design and implement the database schema
   - Create subscriber management interfaces
   - Build newsletter creation and editing tools
   - Implement sending and tracking functionality

## Success Criteria

By the end of Session 6, we should have:

- A fully functional resident authentication system with proper security measures
- Complete profile management capabilities for residents
- A real-time messaging system between residents and management
- Package tracking interfaces for residents to monitor deliveries
- A searchable knowledge base of building information
- An enhanced inquiry management system with improved response workflows
- A newsletter system for building-wide communications
