# Session 3 Kickoff: Resident Messaging & Package Management

## Session Overview
April 4, 2025

Building on our successful implementation of the document management system and theme functionality in Session 2, Session 3 will focus on enhancing resident communication capabilities and completing the package management system. These features aim to improve day-to-day operations for both the condominium management team and residents.

## Key Focus Areas

### 1. Internal Messaging System
We'll implement a comprehensive messaging system that enables secure communication between:
- Board members to residents (broadcasts/announcements)
- Residents to board members (inquiries/requests)
- Residents to staff (service requests)
- Staff to residents (notifications/updates)

This system will support both direct and group messaging capabilities, with features for attachments, read receipts, and notifications.

### 2. Package Management System
We'll complete the package notification system to streamline the process of logging, tracking, and notifying residents about package deliveries. Key features include:
- Package logging interface for concierge/doorman
- QR code generation for package tracking
- Resident notification system
- Package pickup confirmation
- Reporting and analytics
- Mobile-friendly interfaces for all operations

### 3. User Experience & Accessibility
Throughout our implementations, we'll prioritize:
- Mobile responsiveness for all new features
- Accessibility compliance (WCAG 2.1 AA standards)
- Performance optimization for slower connections
- Intuitive user interfaces with clear feedback

## Technical Implementation
