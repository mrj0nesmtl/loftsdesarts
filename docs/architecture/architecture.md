# Architecture Documentation

This directory contains documentation related to the overall system architecture of the Lofts des Arts platform, providing insights into the technical design decisions, patterns, and infrastructure.

## Contents

- `/diagrams/` - System architecture diagrams and flowcharts
- `/infrastructure/` - Server and deployment infrastructure documentation
- `/security/` - Security architecture and considerations
- `/patterns/` - Design patterns used throughout the application

## System Overview

The Lofts des Arts platform is built using a modern web architecture with the following core components:

### Frontend Architecture

- **Next.js 14** - React framework with App Router for server-side rendering and routing
- **TypeScript** - Type-safe code with strict type checking
- **Tailwind CSS** - Utility-first CSS framework for styling
- **Shadcn/UI** - Component library for UI elements
- **Zustand** - State management library

### Backend Architecture

- **Supabase** - Backend-as-a-Service (BaaS) providing:
  - PostgreSQL database
  - Authentication and authorization
  - Storage for files and documents
  - Realtime subscriptions
  - Row-Level Security policies
- **Next.js API Routes** - Serverless functions for custom backend logic
- **Webhooks** - For integration with external services

### Data Flow

The application follows a client-server architecture with:
1. Client-side rendering for dynamic UI elements
2. Server-side rendering for initial page loads and SEO
3. Direct database access through Supabase client for authenticated operations
4. API routes for complex operations requiring server-side processing

### Security Architecture

- JWT-based authentication
- Row-Level Security (RLS) policies at the database level
- Role-based access control (RBAC)
- HTTPS encryption for all communications
- Content Security Policy (CSP) implementation

### Deployment Architecture

- **Development Environment**: Local development with Next.js dev server
- **Staging Environment**: Replit deployment with continuous integration
- **Production Environment**: Replit deployment with custom domain

## Key Architectural Decisions

1. **Supabase as Backend**: Chosen for its PostgreSQL foundation, built-in auth, and realtime capabilities
2. **Next.js App Router**: Provides enhanced page routing, layouts, and server components
3. **TypeScript**: Ensures type safety across the codebase
4. **Serverless Architecture**: Eliminates the need for dedicated server management
5. **Role-Based Security**: Implements security at both application and database levels

## Architecture Diagrams

The `/diagrams/` directory contains detailed visual representations of:

- System component interactions
- Data flow diagrams
- Entity relationship diagrams
- Authentication flow
- Deployment architecture

## Performance Considerations

- Edge caching for static assets
- Incremental Static Regeneration (ISR) for semi-dynamic content
- Image optimization via Next.js Image component
- Client-side caching strategies
- Lazy loading of components and routes

## Scalability

The architecture is designed to scale horizontally with:

- Stateless application design
- Database connection pooling
- CDN integration for static assets
- Serverless functions that scale automatically
